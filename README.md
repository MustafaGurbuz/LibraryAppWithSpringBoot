# LibraryAppWithSpringBoot
I made an Library Web Project with Java Spring first time in my life. The front-end is made using HTML/CSS. Spring framework is really affective and impresive for me. Because even it is first time for me to use this technology after making some search I easily adapted and made an such an great Web Project. This project is just an beginning for me. I also made some projects with using Java. So it wasn't so difficult for me.
